# login-page

Contains four files index.html, styles.css, scripts.js, auth.php.
using XAMPP , by using apache and sql, I have created a database with name login page and created a table with name users containing five columns id, username, email, password, dob.
This login page verifies email id and password with the existing data in the database. If the data matches then message gets displayed as login is successful. If the data does not match then message invalid login will be displayed.
There is a signup option for the new users which asks four details username, email, password, dob. After providing these details user will successfully logged in and his login details will automatically added to the database.
